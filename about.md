About the Chicago Crime Analysis Project

Dataset Overview:
This project uses Chicago crime data from the years 2018 to 2022. The dataset provides insights into crime trends, arrest rates, and geographical distributions across the city. Due to the size of the dataset, it is hosted externally. You can access the dataset via the following link:

Dataset Description:
- File Name: Crimes_-_2018_to_2022.csv
- Size: ~225 MB
- Fields:
  - ID: Unique identifier for each reported crime.
  - Date: The exact time and date of the crime occurrence.
  - Primary Type: General classification of the crime (e.g., Theft, Battery).
  - Location Description: Where the crime took place (e.g., Street, Residence).
  - Arrest: A boolean field indicating whether an arrest was made (True/False).
  - Domestic: Whether the crime was a domestic incident (True/False).
  - Latitude/Longitude: Geographic coordinates for mapping.
  - Ward, Community Area, District: Administrative divisions in Chicago.

Data Cleaning & Preparation:
- The dataset was cleaned to remove any null or duplicate values.
- Crime types were categorized for better aggregation and analysis.
- Aggregations by time (year, month, hour) and location (wards, districts) were created for trend analysis.

Project Features:
This Tableau project includes multiple interactive dashboards, a storybook, and dynamic visualizations to analyze Chicago crime data. The key features include:

1. Crime Trends Over Time:
   - Bar charts and line graphs show crime distribution over the five-year period.
   - Users can apply filters by year, crime type, and location to observe trends.

2. Peak Crime Hours and Top Crimes:
   - Analysis of crimes occurring during peak hours, visualized using line graphs.
   - Drill-down into the most frequent crimes based on time of day.

3. Crime Locations and Distribution by Ward:
   - Geographical mapping of crime density across Chicago’s 50 wards.
   - Filters allow users to focus on specific wards or types of crime.

4. Arrest Analysis:
   - A pie chart comparing the percentage of crimes that led to arrests versus those that did not.
   - The dataset shows an 18% arrest rate.

5. FBI Code and Crime Severity:
   - FBI classification codes are used to categorize crimes by severity.
   - Treemaps and bar charts highlight the most severe crimes in each location.

Calculated Fields and Interactivity:
- Crime Count by Year: A custom field that aggregates the total number of crimes per year.
- Arrest Rate: A calculated field that shows the percentage of crimes leading to arrests.
- Geographic Calculations: Used to analyze crime density based on latitude and longitude.
- Filters and Cross-Dashboard Interactivity: Clicking on any crime type, location, or time element dynamically updates the rest of the dashboard.
